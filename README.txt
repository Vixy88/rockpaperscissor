Having enrolled into the General Assembly Software Engineer Immersive course, I was asked to do some prework which included a project to create your own Rock, Paper and Scissor game.


I had a lot of fun making this and had some great inspiration from a lot of other great games online. 

A special thanks to @pritishnagpal for sharing his version, it really helped me understand how to add a scoreboard, check his version out here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rock-paper-and-scissor-game-using-javascript/.
